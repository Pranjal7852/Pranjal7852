I'm a Software Developer focused on writing clean, efficient code that performs well. I specialise in building scalable front-end systems and the backend infrastructure to support them, ensuring they can handle heavy traffic and complex UI needs.

I‚Äôm passionate about maintaining high standards in software design and development. I enjoy diving deep into system analysis, testing software thoroughly, and staying current with new tools and technologies. My goal is always to create software that‚Äôs reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

I've recently immersed myself in the startup culture, particularly in the EdTech space, with a strong focus on helping children aged 9-12 make the most of technology. I worked on a social media platform for kids at a London-based startup called Circlone. Currently, I'm based in Bangalore, working with The Homework App and developing a hybrid app called MathAI (available on the Play Store). MathAI, built on Next.JS, leverages advanced AI tools to help students learn math effectively.
